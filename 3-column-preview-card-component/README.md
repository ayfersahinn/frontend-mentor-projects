## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS with variables and nesting (for maintainable and modular styling)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries and other responsive techniques

### What I learned

I learned how the align-items: stretch property in Flexbox automatically makes flex items match the containerâ€™s height, which helped me keep all cards evenly aligned in the layout.
