## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS with variables and nesting (for maintainable and modular styling)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries and other responsive techniques

### What I learned

- Making the image section fully responsive, ensuring it scales and crops correctly across different screen sizes using object-fit and flexible dimensions.

- Using SCSS features like nesting and variables for clean and maintainable styling.

- Implementing mobile-first design with media queries so both content and images adapt smoothly.
